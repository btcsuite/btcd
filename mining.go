// The transactions selected and included are prioritized according to several
// factors.  First, each transaction has a priority calculated based on its
// value, age of inputs, and size.  Transactions which consist of larger
// amounts, older inputs, and small sizes have the highest priority.  Second, a
// fee per kilobyte is calculated for each transaction.  Transactions with a
// higher fee per kilobyte are preferred.  Finally, the block generation related
// policy settings are all taken into account.
//
// Transactions which only spend outputs from other transactions already in the
// block chain are immediately added to a priority queue which either
// prioritizes based on the priority (then fee per kilobyte) or the fee per
// kilobyte (then priority) depending on whether or not the BlockPrioritySize
// policy setting allots space for high-priority transactions.  Transactions
// which spend outputs from other transactions in the source pool are added to a
// dependency map so they can be added to the priority queue once the
// transactions they depend on have been included.
//
// Once the high-priority area (if configured) has been filled with
// transactions, or the priority falls below what is considered high-priority,
// the priority queue is updated to prioritize by fees per kilobyte (then
// priority).
//
// When the fees per kilobyte drop below the TxMinFreeFee policy setting, the
// transaction will be skipped unless the BlockMinSize policy setting is
// nonzero, in which case the block will be filled with the low-fee/free
// transactions until the block size reaches that minimum size.
//
// Any transactions which would cause the block to exceed the BlockMaxSize
// policy setting, exceed the maximum allowed signature operations per block, or
// otherwise cause the block to be invalid are skipped.
//
// Given the above, a block generated by this function is of the following form:
