// BuildMerkleTreeStore creates a merkle tree from a slice of transactions,
// stores it using a linear array, and returns a slice of the backing array.  A
// linear array was chosen as opposed to an actual tree structure since it uses
// about half as much memory.  The following describes a merkle tree and how it
// is stored in a linear array.
//
// A merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is the hash of its
// children nodes.  A diagram depicting how this works for bitcoin transactions
// where h(x) is a double sha256 follows:
//
//	         root = h1234 = h(h12 + h34)
//	        /                           \
//	  h12 = h(h1 + h2)            h34 = h(h3 + h4)
//	   /            \              /            \
//	h1 = h(tx1)  h2 = h(tx2)    h3 = h(tx3)  h4 = h(tx4)
//
// The above stored as a linear array is as follows:
//
// 	[h1 h2 h3 h4 h12 h34 root]
//
// As the above shows, the merkle root is always the last element in the array.
//
// The number of inputs is not always a power of two which results in a
// balanced tree structure as above.  In that case, parent nodes with no
// children are also zero and parent nodes with only a single left node
// are calculated by concatenating the left node with itself before hashing.
// Since this function uses nodes that are pointers to the hashes, empty nodes
// will be nil.
func BuildMerkleTreeStore(transactions []*btcutil.Tx) []*chainhash.Hash {
	// Calculate how many entries are required to hold the binary merkle
	// tree as a linear array and create an array of that size.
	nextPoT := nextPowerOfTwo(len(transactions))

	// next power of two.
	offset := nextPoT
	for i := 0; i < arraySize-1; i += 2 {
		switch {
		// When there is no left child node, the parent is nil too.
		case merkles[i] == nil:
			merkles[offset] = nil

		// When there is no right child, the parent is generated by
