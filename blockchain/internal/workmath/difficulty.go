// CompactToBig converts a compact representation of a whole number N to an

// point numbers.
//
// Like IEEE754 floating point, there are three basic components: the sign,
// the exponent, and the mantissa.  They are broken out as follows:
//
// - the most significant 8 bits represent the unsigned base 256 exponent
// - bit 23 (the 24th bit) represents the sign bit
// - the least significant 23 bits represent the mantissa
//
//	-------------------------------------------------
//	|   Exponent     |    Sign    |    Mantissa     |
//	-------------------------------------------------
//	| 8 bits [31-24] | 1 bit [23] | 23 bits [22-00] |
//	-------------------------------------------------
//
// The formula to calculate N is:
//
//	N = (-1^sign) * mantissa * 256^(exponent-3)

// which represent difficulty targets, thus there really is not a need for a
// sign bit, but it is implemented here to stay consistent with bitcoind.
