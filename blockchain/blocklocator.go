// BlockLocator is used to help locate a specific block.  The algorithm for
// building the block locator is to add the hashes in reverse order until
// the genesis block is reached.  In order to keep the list of locator hashes
// to a reasonable number of entries, first the most recent previous 10 block
// hashes are added, then the step is doubled each loop iteration to
// exponentially decrease the number of hashes as a function of the distance
// from the block being located.
//
// For example, assume you have a block chain with a side chain as depicted
// below:
// 	genesis -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 15 -> 16  -> 17  -> 18
// 	                              \-> 16a -> 17a
//
// The block locator for block 17a would be the hashes of blocks:
// [17a 16a 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 6 2 genesis]
type BlockLocator []*wire.ShaHash

// BlockLocatorFromHash returns a block locator for the passed block hash.
// See BlockLocator for details on the algotirhm used to create a block locator.
//
// In addition to the general algorithm referenced above, there are a couple of
// special cases which are handled:
//
//  - If the genesis hash is passed, there are no previous hashes to add and
//    therefore the block locator will only consist of the genesis hash
//  - If the passed hash is not currently known, the block locator will only
//    consist of the passed hash
