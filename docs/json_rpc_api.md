### 1. Overview

dcrd provides a [JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification) API that is
fully compatible with the original bitcoind/bitcoin-qt.  There are a few key
differences between dcrd and bitcoind as far as how RPCs are serviced:
* Unlike bitcoind that has the wallet and chain intermingled in the same process
  which leads to several issues, dcrd intentionally splits the wallet and chain
  services into independent processes.  See the blog post
  [here](https://blog.conformal.com/btcd-not-your-moms-bitcoin-daemon/) for
  further details on why they were separated.  This means that if you are
  talking directly to dcrd, only chain-related RPCs are available.  However both
  chain-related and wallet-related RPCs are available via
  [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet).
* dcrd is secure by default which means that the RPC connection is TLS-enabled
  by default
* dcrd provides access to the API through both
  [HTTP POST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29) requests and
  [Websockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

Websockets are the preferred transport for dcrd RPC and are used by applications
such as [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) for inter-process
communication with dcrd.  The websocket connection endpoint for dcrd is
`wss://your_ip_or_domain:9109/ws`.

In addition to the [standard API](#Methods), an [extension API](#WSExtMethods)
has been developed that is exclusive to clients using Websockets. In its current
state, this API attempts to cover features found missing in the standard API
during the development of dcrwallet.

While the [standard API](#Methods) is stable, the
[Websocket extension API](#WSExtMethods) should be considered a work in
progress, incomplete, and susceptible to changes (both additions and removals).

The original bitcoind/bitcoin-qt JSON-RPC API documentation is available at [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list)

<a name="HttpPostVsWebsockets" />

### 2. HTTP POST Versus Websockets

The dcrd RPC server supports both [HTTP POST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29)
requests and the preferred [Websockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).
All of the standard and extension methods described in
this documentation can be accessed through both. As the name
indicates, the [Websocket-specific extension](#WSExtMethods) methods can only be
accessed when connected via Websockets.

As mentioned in the [overview](#Overview), the websocket connection endpoint for
dcrd is `wss://your_ip_or_domain:9109/ws`.

The most important differences between the two transports as it pertains to the
JSON-RPC API are:

|   |HTTP POST Requests|Websockets|
|---|------------------|----------|
|Allows multiple requests across a single connection|Yes|Yes|
|Supports asynchronous notifications|No|Yes|
|Scales well with large numbers of requests|No|Yes|

<a name="Authentication" />

### 3. Authentication

<a name="AuthenticationOverview" />

**3.1 Authentication Overview**<br />

The following authentication details are needed before establishing a connection
to a dcrd RPC server:

* **rpcuser** is the full-access username configured for the dcrd RPC server
* **rpcpass** is the full-access password configured for the dcrd RPC server
* **rpclimituser** is the limited username configured for the dcrd RPC server
* **rpclimitpass** is the limited password configured for the dcrd RPC server
* **rpccert** is the PEM-encoded X.509 certificate (public key) that the dcrd
  server is configured with.  It is automatically generated by dcrd and placed
  in the dcrd home directory (which is typically `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dcrd` on
  Windows and `~/.dcrd` on POSIX-like OSes)

**NOTE:** As mentioned above, dcrd is secure by default which means the RPC
server is not running unless configured with a **rpcuser** and **rpcpass**
and/or a **rpclimituser** and **rpclimitpass**, and uses TLS authentication for
all connections.

Depending on which connection type you are using, you can choose one of
two, mutually exclusive, methods.
- [Use HTTP Authorization Header](#HTTPAuth) - HTTP POST requests and Websockets
- [Use the JSON-RPC "authenticate" command](#JSONAuth) - Websockets only

<a name="HTTPAuth" />

**3.2 HTTP Basic Access Authentication**<br />

The dcrd RPC server uses HTTP [basic access authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) with the **rpcuser**
and **rpcpass** detailed above.  If the supplied credentials are invalid, you
will be disconnected immediately upon making the connection.

<a name="JSONAuth" />

**3.3 JSON-RPC Authenticate Command (Websocket-specific)**<br />

While the HTTP basic access authentication method is the preferred method, the
ability to set HTTP headers from websockets is not always available.  In that
case, you will need to use the [authenticate](#authenticate) JSON-RPC method.

The [authenticate](#authenticate) command must be the first command sent after
connecting to the websocket.  Sending any other commands before authenticating,
supplying invalid credentials, or attempting to authenticate again when already
authenticated will cause the websocket to be closed immediately.


<a name="CLIUtil" />

### 4. Command-line Utility

dcrd comes with a separate utility named `dcrctl` which can be used to issue
these RPC commands via HTTP POST requests to dcrd after configuring it with the
information in the [Authentication](#Authentication) section above.  It can also
be used to communicate with any server/daemon/service which provides a JSON-RPC
API compatible with the original dcrd client.

### 7. Notifications (Websocket-specific)

dcrd uses standard JSON-RPC notifications to notify clients of changes, rather than requiring clients to poll dcrd for updates.  JSON-RPC notifications are a subset of requests, but do not contain an ID.  The notification type is categorized by the `method` field and additional details are sent as a JSON array in the `params` field.

<a name="NotificationOverview" />

**7.1 Notification Overview**<br />

The following is an overview of the JSON-RPC notifications used for Websocket connections.  Click the method name for further details of the context(s) in which they are sent and their parameters.

### 8. Example Code

This section provides example code for interacting with the JSON-RPC API in
various languages.

* [Go](#ExampleGoApp)
* [node.js](#ExampleNodeJsCode)

<a name="ExampleGoApp" />

**8.1 Go**

This section provides examples of using the RPC interface using Go and the
[rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/rpcclient) package.

* [Using getblockcount to Retrieve the Current Block Height](#ExampleGetBlockCount)
* [Using getblock to Retrieve the Genesis Block](#ExampleGetBlock)
* [Using notifyblocks to Receive blockconnected and blockdisconnected Notifications (Websocket-specific)](#ExampleNotifyBlocks)


<a name="ExampleGetBlockCount" />

**8.1.1 Using getblockcount to Retrieve the Current Block Height**<br />

The following is an example Go application which uses the
[rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/rpcclient) package to connect with
a dcrd instance via Websockets, issues [getblockcount](#getblockcount) to
retrieve the current block height, and displays it.

```Go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"path/filepath"

	"github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrutil"
	"github.com/decred/dcrd/rpcclient"
)

func main() {
	// Load the certificate for the TLS connection which is automatically
	// generated by dcrd when it starts the RPC server and doesn't already
	// have one.
	dcrdHomeDir := dcrutil.AppDataDir("dcrd", false)
	certs, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filepath.Join(dcrdHomeDir, "rpc.cert"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Create a new RPC client using websockets.  Since this example is
	// not long-lived, the connection will be closed as soon as the program
	// exits.
	connCfg := &rpcclient.ConnConfig{
		Host:         "localhost:9109",
		Endpoint:     "ws",
		User:         "yourrpcuser",
		Pass:         "yourrpcpass",
		Certificates: certs,
	}
	client, err := rpcclient.New(connCfg, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer client.Shutdown()

	// Query the RPC server for the current block count and display it.
	blockCount, err := client.GetBlockCount()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Printf("Block count: %d", blockCount)
}
```

Which results in:

```bash
Block count: 203528
```

**8.1.2 Using getblock to Retrieve the Genesis Block**<br />

The following is an example Go application which uses the
[rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/rpcclient) package to connect with
a dcrd instance via Websockets, issues [getblock](#getblock) to retrieve
information about the Genesis block, and display a few details about it.

```Go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"path/filepath"
	"time"

	"github.com/decred/dcrd/chaincfg/chainhash"

	certs, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filepath.Join(dcrdHomeDir, "rpc.cert"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Create a new RPC client using websockets.  Since this example is
	// not long-lived, the connection will be closed as soon as the program
	// exits.
	connCfg := &rpcclient.ConnConfig{
		Host:         "localhost:9109",
		Endpoint:     "ws",
		User:         "yourrpcuser",
		Pass:         "yourrpcpass",
		Certificates: certs,
	}
	client, err := rpcclient.New(connCfg, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer client.Shutdown()

	// Query the RPC server for the genesis block using the "getblock"
	// command with the verbose flag set to true and the verboseTx flag
	// set to false.
	genesisHashStr := "298e5cc3d985bfe7f81dc135f360abe089edd4396b86d2de66b0cef42b21d980"
	blockHash, err := chainhash.NewHashFromStr(genesisHashStr)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	block, err := client.GetBlockVerbose(blockHash, false)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Display some details about the returned block.
	log.Printf("Hash: %v\n", block.Hash)
	log.Printf("Previous Block: %v\n", block.PreviousHash)
	log.Printf("Next Block: %v\n", block.NextHash)
	log.Printf("Merkle root: %v\n", block.MerkleRoot)

	log.Printf("Size (in bytes): %v\n", block.Size)
	log.Printf("Num transactions: %v\n", len(block.Tx))
}
```

Which results in:

**8.1.3 Using notifyblocks to Receive blockconnected and blockdisconnected
Notifications (Websocket-specific)**<br />

The following is an example Go application which uses the
[rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/rpcclient) package to connect with
a dcrd instance via Websockets and registers for
[blockconnected](#blockconnected) and [blockdisconnected](#blockdisconnected)
notifications with [notifyblocks](#notifyblocks).  It also sets up handlers for
the notifications.

```Go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"path/filepath"
	"time"

	"github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrutil"
	"github.com/decred/dcrd/rpcclient"
)

func main() {
	// Setup handlers for blockconnected and blockdisconnected
	// notifications.
	ntfnHandlers := rpcclient.NotificationHandlers{
		OnBlockConnected: func(blockHeader []byte, transactions [][]byte) {
			log.Printf("Block connected: %x (%d txs)", blockHeader, len(transactions))

		},
		OnBlockDisconnected: func(blockHeader []byte) {
			log.Printf("Block disconnected: %x", blockHeader)
		},
	}

	// Load the certificate for the TLS connection which is automatically
	// generated by dcrd when it starts the RPC server and doesn't already
	// have one.
	dcrdHomeDir := dcrutil.AppDataDir("dcrd", false)
	certs, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filepath.Join(dcrdHomeDir, "rpc.cert"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Create a new RPC client using websockets.
	connCfg := &rpcclient.ConnConfig{
		Host:         "localhost:9109",
		Endpoint:     "ws",
		User:         "yourrpcuser",
		Pass:         "yourrpcpass",
		Certificates: certs,
	}
	client, err := rpcclient.New(connCfg, &ntfnHandlers)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Register for blockconnected and blockdisconneted notifications.
	if err := client.NotifyBlocks(); err != nil {
		client.Shutdown()
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// For this example, gracefully shutdown the client after 10 seconds.
	// Ordinarily when to shutdown the client is highly application
	// specific.
	log.Println("Client shutdown in 10 seconds...")
	time.AfterFunc(time.Second*10, func() {
		log.Println("Client shutting down...")
		client.Shutdown()
		log.Println("Client shutdown complete.")
	})

	// Wait until the client either shuts down gracefully (or the user
	// terminates the process with Ctrl+C).
	client.WaitForShutdown()
}
```

Example output:

```
Client shutdown in 10 seconds...
Block connected: 050000008478546af6812f4b3cb2148b5967b2dab78c3438d31821760f000000000000002c5f513f6ed478b90a7fc3525bbd64d16ab9b577c6b01861a1e9438f42e22ad95369522fdb6d393edf7eff3f0b33e93b60361fef1ec678843faae2caec0b782701003406e68c8961050013004aa00000e21668193dcd2d0302000000a21d03002bed00003b125d5a005fd38e00000000f1ea07e25fff20eb000000000000000000000000000000000000000005000000 (0 txs)

### 8.2. Example node.js Code

<a name="ExampleNotifyBlocks" />

**8.2.1 Using notifyblocks to be Notified of Block Connects and Disconnects**<br />

The following is example node.js code which uses [ws](https://github.com/einaros/ws)
(can be installed with `npm install ws`) to connect with a dcrd instance,
issues [notifyblocks](#notifyblocks) to register for
[blockconnected](#blockconnected) and [blockdisconnected](#blockdisconnected)
notifications, and displays all incoming messages.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var WebSocket = require('ws');

// Load the certificate for the TLS connection which is automatically
// generated by dcrd when it starts the RPC server and doesn't already
// have one.
var cert = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/dcrd/appdata/rpc.cert');
var user = "yourusername";
var password = "yourpassword";


// Initiate the websocket connection.  The dcrd generated certificate acts as
// its own certificate authority, so it needs to be specified in the 'ca' array
// for the certificate to properly validate.
var ws = new WebSocket('wss://127.0.0.1:9109/ws', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic '+new Buffer(user+':'+password).toString('base64')
  },
  cert: cert,
  ca: [cert]
});
ws.on('open', function() {
    console.log('CONNECTED');
    // Send a JSON-RPC command to be notified when blocks are connected and
    // disconnected from the chain.
    ws.send('{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"0","method":"notifyblocks","params":[]}');
});
ws.on('message', function(data, flags) {
    console.log(data);
});
ws.on('error', function(derp) {
  console.log('ERROR:' + derp);
})
ws.on('close', function(data) {
  console.log('DISCONNECTED');
})
```
